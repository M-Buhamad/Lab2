Project Title: Telco Customer Churn Analysis
Assignment 2 - Machine Learning Lab
1. Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset. It contains information about a biological telecommunications company and its customers.

Dataset Size: The data consists of 7,043 rows and 21 columns.

Key Features:

Demographics: Gender, Senior Citizen, Partner, and Dependents.

Services: Phone service, Multiple lines, Internet service, Online security, Online backup, Device protection, Tech support, and Streaming TV/Movies.

Account Info: Tenure, Contract type, Paperless billing, Payment method, Monthly charges, and Total charges.

Target Variable: The column Churn, which indicates whether the customer left the company within the last month.

2. Machine Learning Problem
The primary objective is to address a Binary Classification problem. We aim to build a model that can predict the likelihood of a customer churning (Yes or No) based on their usage behavior and demographic attributes. This helps the company proactively identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.
